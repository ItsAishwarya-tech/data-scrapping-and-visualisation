IMDB Movie Ratings Extraction and Visualization using Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL. Extracted IMDB movie ratings using Selenium, cleaned and stored the data in CSV, and performed data analysis and visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL for filtering.
This project involves the extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of movie ratings data from IMDB using Selenium for web scraping. The extracted data was processed and stored in a CSV file for further analysis.
I utilized Pandas for data manipulation, and employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that highlight patterns and trends within the dataset. Additionally, I used SQL for efficient querying and filtering of the data to extract meaningful insights.
The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow—from web data extraction and preprocessing to visualization and filtering—showcasing practical applications of Python, Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL.
